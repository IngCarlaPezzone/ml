    "# Sistema de Recomendación Interactivo con Embeddings de Palabras usando Word2Vec, Plotly, y NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "¡Bienvenido a este proyecto! Vamos a explorar cómo construir un modelo que pueda entender las palabras de una manera matemática, de manera que las palabras con significados similares que comparten ciertas características estén cerca unas de otras en el espacio vectorial. Es una forma elegante de decir que las representaciones matemáticas de las palabras que tienen un significado similar están cerca unas de otras, y las palabras que no comparten mucho significado están más alejadas. Demostraremos que este modelo puede adaptarse para ser utilizado en un sistema de recomendación, o como una herramienta de descubrimiento (es decir, no tenemos esto en stock, ¿tal vez le gustaría esta alternativa?).\n",

    "\n",
    "Utilizaremos un conjunto de datos de recetas para entrenar un modelo que aprenda las interacciones entre los distintos tipos de ingredientes y los productos disponibles en un supermercado. Este modelo puede aplicarse de varias maneras, por ejemplo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Para recomendar productos en función de los artículos añadidos a la cesta;\n",
    "- Para ofrecer productos alternativos en función de las existencias;\n",
    "- Descubrir nuevos productos para crear diferentes recetas.\n",

    "En dicha demo se ve una visualización de word embedding. cada uno de estos nodos representa un ingrediente, los cuales tienen links entre ellos en una forma semantica de agrupamiento. Por ejemplo, a la izquierda puede ver raspberries, blackberries y blueberries, lo que significa que estos tres items obviamente estan relacionados. Evidentemente vemos que se puede construir un modelo que puede relacionar estas tres palabras sin que le digamos nada.\n",

    "Lo que vimos en la primera tarea, básicamente es cómo un modelo aprende una representación de cada palabra en un corpus dado. De manera que las palabras que tienen algún tipo de significado semántico existen cerca unas de otras en el espacio vectorial. Lo que significa que las palabras que tienen algún tipo de contexto similar en el lenguaje humano existirán cerca unas de otras en las presentaciones vectoriales matemática. Así, por ejemplo, un gato y un perro pueden estar muy relacionados. Los dos vectores de entonces, por ejemplo, un perro y un balón de fútbol estarán un poco más separados. \n",
    "\n",
    "Los documentos originales de Word2Vec pueden encontrarse [aquí](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) y [aquí](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf), mientras que la documentación del modelo Gensim puede encontrarse [aquí](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Esencialmente, estos son dos enfoques diferentes: **CBOW** (bolsa de palabras) y **Skip Graham**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- En el modelo CBOW usted entrena una red neuronal para tomar en una cierta cantidad de palabras como entrada y para predecir la palabra media. Así que, por ejemplo, si estás viendo la palabra $w(t)$, tomará como contexto las dos palabras anteriores y las dos palabras posteriores en este ejemplo. Algunos de estos vectores intentan predecir la palabra que está en el medio. \n",
    "\n",
    "- En el modelo Skip Graham básicamente ya tienes una entrada, y tratas de predecir las palabras que la rodean. Así que esto es una especie de opuestos entre sí. Pero están logrando lo mismo y que están aprendiendo un contexto alrededor de la palabra dada y luego predecir esa palabra o predecir el contexto. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Word2Vec architecture](data/word2vec.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usaremos Word2Vec en su forma más básica en la configuración por defecto, que en realidad está configurada para ser una bolsa continua de palabras (CBOW). Y la razón por la que creo que esto es bastante importante es que en nuestro caso, realmente no nos importa el orden de las palabras, mientras que está Skip Graham está más inclinado a ese propósito. Así que, por ejemplo, si alguien dice, las patatas dos, o dos patatas, queremos clasificar y aprender sobre él de la misma manera. "

    "PCA: Creo que un algoritmo de reducción de la dimensionalidad, como un autoencoder o un PCA, podría ser útil para añadir datos a una estructura gráfica existente. Además, también podría ser inteligente añadir algunos datos artificiales de manera que las palabras menos comunes no arrojen exactamente un error, incluso si el modelo tiene menos confianza en estas palabras (¿está de acuerdo con este segundo punto? ¡Para reflexionar!).\n",
